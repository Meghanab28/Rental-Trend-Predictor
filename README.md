# Model Evaluation
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R² Score
Both metrics are printed after model evaluation.


# Visualizations
- Distribution of Rent Prices
- Average Rent per City
- Actual vs Predicted Rent (Scatter Plot)


# Future Improvements
- advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Build a deployment-ready Streamlit app
